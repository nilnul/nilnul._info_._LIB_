	/// to counter the decay of social entropy:
	///		1) inner innovation, like mutual competition of political parties;
	///		2) revolution, as said in materialists' quote: everything that is born would die. To end the old life such that new life of nondecadence can be born.
	///		3) establish an open society. An open system, unlike closed system that is doomed by increased disorder, can exchange with environment and keep being active, innovative, vitalic, energetic and creative and growing like a youngster.
