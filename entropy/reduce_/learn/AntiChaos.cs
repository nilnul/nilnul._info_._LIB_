	/// a physical world tends to become more and more entropied. And this process is nonreversible like <see cref="learn.be_.INonReversible"/>;
	/// However, we can counter this physical decay with human's knowledge, as knowledge can reduce informational entropy, <see cref="reduce_.IByKnowledge"/>;
	/// It is embodied by: when we have more knowledge, we can find the rules, or order out of more complex system. In other words, with knowledge, complexity can be made easy, not that much complex. The reduction of complexity is how we reduce the increased complexity|chaos of the physical world.
	/// put other ways, we increase our knowlede alongwith or ahead of the increasing chaos of the physical world.

	/// <remarks>
	/// eg:
	///		nowadays, evern old people have to deal with the complexity of using a phone, whileas in ancient times people need to.
	///		with the advent of more and more advanced appliances, people get anxious due to the increased chaos. but with knowledge, we can counter the increased knowledge and become easy or evern empowered by the new tools and methods.
