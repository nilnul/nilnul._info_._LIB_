	/// If you share some knowledge to somebody, the receiver can verify the knowledge (say, when it's a logical derivation or a theorem; verifying is easy in comparision with the hardness of prooving or finding it.).
	/// So even you cheat the receiver again by saying that knowledge is false, or you give another contradicting statement to that knowledge in attempt to distill confusion, you would fail due to the aforementioned easiness of verifying a statement, which is easier than your fabicating another contradiction.
